Classes and Objects in Python
Definition and Concept
In Python, similar to Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data and functions into a single construct. An object in Python is an instance of a class, combining attributes (data) and methods (functions) specific to that class.

Creating a Class
Classes in Python are defined using the class keyword. Unlike Java, Python does not require explicit declaration of fields and constructors can be omitted if not needed. Here's a Python equivalent of the Java Car class:

```python

class Car:
    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, brand, year):
        self.brand = brand  # Attribute
        self.year = year    # Attribute

    # Method
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Car Brand: {self.brand}, Year: {self.year}")
```
Explanation:

The Car class in Python has an __init__ method (constructor) for initializing the brand and year attributes. The display_info method is equivalent to Java's displayInfo method.

Creating an Object
Objects in Python are instantiated without the new keyword:


```python

# Creating an object of Car
my_car = Car("Toyota", 2021)

# Calling method on the object
my_car.display_info()
```
Explanation:

Here, my_car is an instance of Car, and calling my_car.display_info() outputs the car's brand and year, similar to Java.
