Constructors in Java
Overview of Classes and Objects
Class: A blueprint for an object that defines its properties and behaviors.
Object: An instance of a class.
Introduction to Constructors
A constructor in Java is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called when an instance of a class is created.

Example Class: Student
java

public class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    double psp;
}
Creating an Object
To create an object of the Student class, we use:

java

Student st = new Student();
Here, Student is the data type, st is the variable name, and new Student() invokes the constructor.

Understanding Constructors
The Student() in new Student() is the constructor.
If no constructor is explicitly defined, Java provides a default constructor.
Default Constructor
Automatically created if no constructor is defined.
Initializes each attribute to its default value: 0 for integers, null for objects, 0.0 for doubles, etc.
Only assigns default values if attributes are not already initialized.
Example of Default Constructor
java

class Student {
    String name;
    int age;
    double psp;
    String univName;

    Student() {
        // This is a default constructor.
        name = null;
        age = 0;
        psp = 0.0;
        univName = null;
    }
}
Note: Writing the default constructor explicitly is not necessary as it is automatically generated.

When is a Default Constructor Not Created?
A default constructor is not created if a class has any other constructor defined.
Characteristics of a Constructor
Same name as the class.
No return type, not even void.
Can be public, private, protected, or package-private (no modifier).
Manual Constructor
Creating a constructor manually allows for more control and customization when creating objects.

Example of a Manual Constructor
java

public class Student {
    String name;
    private int age = 21;
    String univName;
    double psp;

    // Manual constructor
    public Student(String studentName, String universityName) {
        name = studentName;
        univName = universityName;
    }
}
Usage:

java

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student st = new Student("Utkarsh", "JIIT");
    }
}
Copy Constructor
A copy constructor creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.

Example of a Copy Constructor
java

class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Default constructor
    Student() {
        name = null;
        age = 0;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    Student(Student st) {
        name = st.name;
        age = st.age;
    }
}
Usage:

java

Student st1 = new Student();
st1.name = "Utkarsh";
st1.age = 27;

Student st2 = new Student(st1); // Using the copy constructor
Use Case of Copy Constructor
Useful for creating a new object with the same data as an existing object.
Allows copying of private attributes that might not be accessible otherwise.
Difference from Assignment
Student st2 = st1; only points st2 to the same object as st1.
A copy constructor creates a separate object with its own memory space.
