Inheritance in Java
Concept of Inheritance
Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows for creating a hierarchy or relationship between classes, mirroring the way humans categorize and understand real-world entities.

Understanding Inheritance through Hierarchy
Inheritance represents a parent-child relationship between classes.
It allows a child class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods and fields) from a parent class.
Example of Inheritance
java
Copy code
class Animal {
    void walk() {
        System.out.println("Animal walks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
In this example, Dog extends Animal. So, a Dog can both walk and bark. The ability to walk is inherited from the Animal class.

Parent-Child Relationship in Code
The extends keyword in Java is used to establish an inheritance relationship.
The child class inherits all non-private members of the parent class.
Example of Parent-Child Code Relationship
java
Copy code
class User {
    String userName;
    
    void login() {
        // login code
    }
}

class Instructor extends User {
    String batchName;
    double avgRating;
    
    void scheduleClass() {
        // schedule class code
    }
}
In this example, Instructor extends User, inheriting the userName and login() method.

Constructor Chaining in Inheritance
Constructor chaining refers to the process where a child class constructor calls the constructor of its parent class.

How Constructor Chaining Works
When an object of a child class is created, the constructor of the parent class is called first.
If the child class does not explicitly call a super constructor, the default constructor of the parent class is invoked.
Example of Constructor Chaining
java
Copy code
class A {
    A() {
        System.out.println("Constructor of A");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    B() {
        System.out.println("Constructor of B");
    }
}

class C extends B {
    C() {
        System.out.println("Constructor of C");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C c = new C(); // This will print constructors of A, B, and C in order.
    }
}
Using super in Constructors
The super keyword is used to explicitly call a parent class constructor.
It must be the first statement in the child class constructor.
Example Using super
java
Copy code
class C extends B {
    C(String message) {
        super(); // Calls constructor of B
        System.out.println("Constructor of C with message: " + message);
    }
}
Abstraction in Inheritance
Inheritance supports the concept of abstraction, allowing more generic (parent) classes to define a common interface or behavior, which specialized (child) classes can implement or extend.
